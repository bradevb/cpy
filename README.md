# cpy.py

Copies all files, along with their Mac OS specific resource forks, system attributes, and/or Finder tags, to a non-Mac filesystem.
Stores progress and picks up where it left off.

Unfortunately, was only designed for Mac OS Yosemite, and is unlikely to work on newer versions of Mac OS, or Python versions other than (I believe) Python 2.7.
It could be updated for newer versions, but I'm not sure if the interest is there. If there is an interested party, please create an issue, and I'll
look it. Pull requests are also welcome.
